Final Project for CS230: Deep Learning

We develop a novel application of a partial convolutional neural network (PCNN) to inpaint noisy portions of experimentally retrieved Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization maps. Due to its weak radiative signal, CMB maps can often be contaminated by extragalactic radio sources and galactic dust, leading to incomplete observations. Inpainting, or restoring missing patches of pixels in images, has seen marked progress in other fields with generative deep learning algorithms. Adapting these frameworks to cosmology, we will reconstruct sections of CMB maps cropped along the equatorial plane and overlayed with a masking mimicking thermal dust emissions. In generating predictions for this missing data, our PCNN achieves a runtime three orders of magnitude faster than Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical simulations per retrieved patch and accurately recovers the angular power spectrum with 1% error down to angular scales of roughly 3 arc minutes. Implementing this flexible, yet accurate result drastically reduces the computational expense when compared to traditional numerical methods and shows promise with inpainting other complex, non-Gaussian data distributions beyond astrophysics.
